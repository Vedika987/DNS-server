# DNS-server

The Personal DNS Server is a custom-built application designed to process both basic and advanced DNS queries. 
It efficiently parses DNS headers, questions, and response sections, ensuring accurate query resolution. The server supports recursive and iterative lookups by forwarding unresolved queries to external DNS servers. 
It also handles edge cases such as CNAME records and time-to-live (TTL) values, ensuring compliance with DNS protocol standards. The project involved developing custom packet parsers and response generators, providing deep insights into low-level networking. 
Built using Python, the server emphasizes scalability, robustness, and efficient memory usage, making it suitable for small-scale network environments.
